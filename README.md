# ViaBedrock
ViaVersion addon to add support for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition servers.

ViaBedrock aims to be as compatible and accurate as possible with the Minecraft: Bedrock Edition protocol.

## About this fork
Hi there! This fork is mainly to add my own stuff that is not prob going to be push onto mainstream (cuz there implement is pretty bad...)

## Usage
**ViaBedrock is in very early stages of development and NOT intended for regular use yet.**

If you want to try it out anyway you can download the latest [ViaProxy dev build](https://build.lenni0451.net/job/ViaProxy/) (Click on the **ViaProxy-x.x.x.jar** file).

**Do not report any bugs yet. There are still a lot of things which are not implemented yet.**
